# BraPanBlocks

The current directory contains scripts corresponding to the analysis pipelines used in the Brassica rapa Pan-Blocks manuscript. This includes scripts for constructing the _B. rapa_ Pan-Blocks (stored in the [ConstructPanBlocks](https://github.com/caixu0518/BraPanBlocks/tree/main/ConstructPanBlocks) directory), domestication signal identification pipeline (stored in the [DomesticationSignals](https://github.com/caixu0518/BraPanBlocks/tree/main/DomesticationSignals) directory), population analysis workflows (stored in the [PopulationStructureAnalysis](https://github.com/caixu0518/BraPanBlocks/tree/main/PopulationStructureAnalysis) directory), and variant detection scripts (stored in the [GATKscripts](https://github.com/caixu0518/BraPanBlocks/tree/main/GATKscripts) directory). Most of the scripts are written in Perl and incorporate calls to previously published software. These details will be referenced in our forthcoming manuscript.
